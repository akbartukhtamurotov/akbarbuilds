# About Me

Hello! I'm **Akbar Tukhtamurotov**, Software Developer based in Parkent, Uzbekistan.

## Who I Am

I love to build things and see what happens. Whether it's code, projects, or ideas. This blog serves as a space to document my experiences, share knowledge, and connect with like-minded fellow curious humans. Apart from technologoy, I also love history (especially the ancient history), hiking, craftsmenship and table tennis. 

## What I Do

I've mostly worked as a backend developer throughout my career, but touching the fields like cloud, frontend and very limited Android development along the way. Nowadays I'm mostly busy with screaming at Cloudwatch logs while I do AWS Serverless with TypeScript 🙂
